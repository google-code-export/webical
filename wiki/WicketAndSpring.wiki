== Wicket-Spring setup ==

  * The wicket -servlet is set as the default servlet in the web.xml
  * The WebicalApplication is injected by spring in the applicationContext 

By extending the `AnnotSpringWebapplication` in the `WebicalApplication` its possible to let Spring inject dependencies like managers etc. using the `@SpringBean` annotation.

== Testing ==
All wicket testcases are subclassed from `WebicalApplicationTest`. This class sets up:

  * The WicketTester to be used to assert all requirements
  * The AnnotApplicationContextMock to insert dependencies that are supposed to be injected by Spring
  * A DummyHomePage to be used in links etc when any page does. 

To test components like panels simply subclass the WebicalApplicationTest and set the PanelTestPage as the startpage inluding your panel/component as the content.
