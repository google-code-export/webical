# How to set up your development environment

== Introduction ==
To start developing webical there are a few steps you need to take. This page lists the requirements and necessary steps to set up the development environment that is need to develop webical. This environment is based on open source software.

This guide assumes you use the default setup. Derivations are possible, but you should have some more understanding of development environments and the components used in Webical.

== Requirements ==
  * Eclipse - http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
  * Maven2 - http://maven.apache.org/download.html
  * Subversion - http://subversion.tigris.org
  * MySQL - http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html

Install the above software in places you find suitable.

== Setting up Maven ==
The maven website states the following:
 Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

We use maven to compile and package Webical and manage all the dependencies in a clear way. Maven works with pom (Project Object Model) files. These xml files are used to configure the project.

To set up Maven2, download it and add it to your system path. Guides on [http://www.troubleshooters.com/linux/prepostpath.htm Linux], [http://vlaurie.com/computers2/Articles/environment.htm Windows] and [http://www.brooksandrus.com/blog/2006/05/24/setting-mac-unix-environment-variables-adding-executables-to-the-system-path/ Mac OSX] are available.

== Setting up Eclipse ==
Download eclipse from the above location and extract it in a suitable directory. Make sure you have java 5 installed.

In order to use Eclipse for Webical development you need to install the `Aspect for J` plugin. This plugin can be downloaded from within Eclispe using the _Find and install software_ option from: Help > Software updates > Find and install ...

The plugin is available from the _Eclipse Europe Discovery Site_. For more information see  [http://www.eclipse.org/ajdt/ the AJDT homepage].

For more Eclipse settings see the [EclipseShortcuts Eclipse shortcuts page].

The next step is to add the Maven2 repository to your Eclipse variables so Eclipse can find the dependencies downloaded by Maven2. To do this open Window > Preferences > Java > Build Path > Classpath Variables. Add a variable named `M2_REPO` that points to _/home/YOUR_NAME/.m2/repository_.


== Setting up the Database ==
For Webical development we use a MySQL database. When running the development version of Webical it will automatically create the database tables. You only need to provide a database named `webical` and a user named `webical` with password `webical` that has all rights to that database. The default settings assume your database is running at _localhost:3306_. Databases with alternative locations will be handled later in this guide.

== Getting the source ==
To start development on Webical, you need its source. We use Subversion as our source control software. You can check out the source, using subversion from http://webical.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/.

You can do this by using the `svn` command line tool, or a graphical interface.
