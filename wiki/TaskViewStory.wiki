    * Dao's
          o Extend the DaoFactory with TaskDaoWebDavHibernateBufferedImpl
          o TaskDao
          o TaskDaoWebDavHibernateBufferedImpl
                + Extend WebDavCalendarSynchronisation with parsing a task 
    * Managers

   Formal Definition: A "VTODO" calendar component is defined by the
   following notation:

     todoc      = "BEGIN" ":" "VTODO" CRLF
                  todoprop *alarmc
                  "END" ":" "VTODO" CRLF

     todoprop   = *(

                ; the following are optional,
                ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                class / completed / created / description / dtstamp /
                dtstart / geo / last-mod / location / organizer /
                percent / priority / recurid / seq / status /
                summary / uid / url /

                ; either 'due' or 'duration' may appear in
                ; a 'todoprop', but 'due' and 'duration'
                ; MUST NOT occur in the same 'todoprop'

                due / duration /
