#Guide on how to install Webical

= Introduction =
This guide will tell you what is needed to install Webical and how to do this step by step.

== Requirements ==
You need to have a couple of things installed on your machine, in order to run Webical.

  * Java 1.5 or higher: http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
  * Tomcat 5.5 or higher: http://tomcat.apache.org/
  * MySQL 5 or higher: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/
  * MySQL Connector/J from: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/ 

== Getting the application ==
There are two ways of obtaining Webical. You can either download the pre build war file to deploy in Tomcat. Or you can get the Webical source from our svn repository and compile it yourself. Both methods are explained below.

=== Pre build ===
The latest pre build war is available in our [http://code.google.com/p/webical/downloads/list download section]. A readme file is included in the Archive with the a short version of this guide. 

If you download the pre build war, you can continue to the `Installation` steps below.

===  Building from Source ===
You can use your favorite svn client to checkout the latest webical source. The url is http://webical.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/.

Execute `svn co http://webical.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ./webical` to download the latest source with the svn commandline client

To have maven build a war for you, enter the `webical` directory and execute `mvn -Denv=release clean package`. 
If you don't have Maven, get it from [http://maven.apache.org/ the apache maven site]. The maven manual is also found on that website.

If all went well, you now have a WAR called ROOT.war in the `webical/webical-war/target/release/` directory. 

== Installation == 
Webical comes with a default installation setup. This is a quick way of getting Webical up and running. 

If you plan on running Webical on a live production server, we suggest you continue with the `Custom installation` part.

=== Default Installation ===
Webical comes with settings for a default installation. If you want to changes these settings, read `Custom installation` below. 

This guide assumes you have Tomcat 5.5 running on `http://localhost:8080/` and MySQL 5 running on `localhost:3306` for the default installation.

If you have build webical from source, rename the ROOT.war to webical.war.

==== Setting up the database ====
Webical uses a database to cache the calendar data. By default, it uses a MySQL database. The default installation assumes you have a database named `webical` and a database user `webical` with password `webical`. This user needs at least SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, INDEX, CREATE and DROP access to the _webical_ database.

With the pre build war, 2 SQL scripts are included. If you checked out the source from svn, these scripts can be found in the _doc_ directory.
Apply `DB_setup.sql` to your database to create the tables needed for the calendar cache.

The default installation uses the same MySQL database for the Tomcat authentication realm. If you want to change to a different way of authenticating, or if you have an existing database with user, read *Custom installation*.
Apply `AUTH_setup.sql` to your database to create the tables needed by Tomcat to authenticate. This script also inserts the first user into the database.
