#Guide on how to install Webical

= Introduction =
This guide will tell you what is needed to install Webical and how to do this step by step.

== Requirements ==
You need to have a couple of things installed on your machine, in order to run Webical.

  * Java 1.5 or higher: http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
  * Tomcat 5.5 or higher: http://tomcat.apache.org/
  * MySQL 5 or higher: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/
  * MySQL Connector/J from: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/ 

== Getting the application ==
There are two ways of obtaining Webical. You can either download the pre build war file to deploy in Tomcat. Or you can get the Webical source from our svn repository and compile it yourself. Both methods are explained below.

=== Pre build ===
The latest pre build war is available in our [http://code.google.com/p/webical/downloads/list download section]. A readme file is included in the Archive with the a short version of this guide. 

If you download the pre build war, you can continue to the `Installation` steps below.

===  Building from Source ===
You can use your favorite svn client to checkout the latest webical source. The url is http://webical.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/.

Execute {{{svn co http://webical.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ./webical}}} to download the latest source with the svn commandline client

To have maven build a war for you, enter the `webical` directory and execute `mvn -Denv=release clean package`. 
If you don't have Maven, get it from [http://maven.apache.org/ the apache maven site]. The maven manual is also found on that website.

If all went well, you now have a WAR called ROOT.war in the `webical/webical-war/target/release/` directory. 

== Installation == 
Webical comes with a default installation setup. This is a quick way of getting Webical up and running. 

If you plan on running Webical on a live production server, we suggest you continue with the `Custom installation` part.

=== Default Installation ===
This guide assumes you have Tomcat 5.5 running on http://localhost:8080/ and MySQL 5 running on localhost:3306 for the default installation.

=== Custom installation ===
