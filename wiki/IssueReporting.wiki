_A guide on how best to file an issue for the developers._

= Introduction =
Too bad you found an issue with Webical :( But we are very happy you are willing to take the time to report it and help us out. This is a short story on how we like issues to be filed so we can jump on them as quick as possible.

== General reporting ==
When you file an issue for us to look at, regardless of whether it is a bug, a feature request or something else entirely, please be as specific as possible. The more specific you are, the more likely we are to know exactly what you mean. This allows us to hopefully quickly and efficiently deal with the matter.

When you typed you very specific description of the issue, be sure to double check it before submitting. You only get one chance! Issue are not editable after they are submitted, and we want to prevent endless replies from the start to correct faults in the issue report.

Be sure to include the following information in your issue report:
  * Version of webical you are using
  * Name and version of your servlet compatible container.
  * The database you are using
