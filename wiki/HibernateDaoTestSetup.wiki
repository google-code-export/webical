  * driverclass - the class of the jdbc driver used for the connection
  * url - the url of the jdbc connection
  * username - the username used to connect
  * password - the password used to connect
  * dialect- the dialect used by hibernate to talk to the driver 

== Adapting the dataset inserted before each test ==
The dataset inserted by dbunit is located in _src/test/resources/dbunit-test-dataset.xml_. You can add additional elements to this file in order to insert them before each test. To try out the test data run `org.webical.dao.impl.DataBaseTest` in eclipse.
