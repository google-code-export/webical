The Webical road map determines what functionality will be implemented at what time.

As you can see the road map is divided in _milestones_. A milestone is set of implemented functions that lead to a release. Each milestone has a target release date.

For a list of complete milestones check out the [CompletedMilestones completed milestones page]. Check out [Features] to see what is now supported.
