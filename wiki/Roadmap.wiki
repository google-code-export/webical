#Webical roadmap

= Introduction =

The Webical roadmap determines what functionality will be implemented at what time.

As you can see the roadmap is devided in _Milstones_. A milestone is set of implemented functions that lead to a release.

Each milestone has a target release date. This date is determined by looking at the functionalities for that milestone and loosely guessing the time it will cost to implement those functionalities.

For a list of complete milestones check out the [CompletedMilestones completed milestones page].
