The Webical road map determines what functionality will be implemented at what time.

As you can see the road map is divided in _milestones_. A milestone is set of implemented functions that lead to a release. Each milestone has a target release date.

Check out the [CompletedMilestones completed milestones] and the [Chagelog changelog]. Also check out the [Features features list] to see what is currently supported.
