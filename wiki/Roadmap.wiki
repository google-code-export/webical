#Webical roadmap

= Introduction =

The Webical roadmap determines what functionality will be implemented at what time.

As you can see the roadmap is devided in _Milstones_. A milestone is set of implemented functions that lead to a release.
Each milestone has a target release date. This date is determined by looking at the functionalities that are to be implemented in the milestone and guessing the time it will cost to do so.
