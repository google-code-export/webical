1. Requirements
   To run Webical, you require the following:
    - Java 1.5 (http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp)
    - Tomcat 5.5 (http://tomcat.apache.org/)
    - MySQL 5 (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#downloads)
    - MySQL Connector/J (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/)

---------------------------

2. Installation

   2.1 Quick start

   This quick start assumes the following:
    - Tomcat is running on localhost:8080
    - MySQL is running on localhost:3306
    - there is a database named 'webical'
    - there is a database user with username 'webical' and
      password 'webical'
    - this user has at least SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, 
      INDEX, CREATE and DROP access to the 'webical' database

   Installation:
    - apply DB_setup.sql to the webical database
    - apply AUTH_setup.sql to the webical database
    - extract the jar from MySQL Connector/J and copy it to
      '$CATALINA_HOME/common/lib/'
    - copy webical.war to '$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/'

   Visit http://localhost:8080/webical/ to start using your Webical
   installation.

   You can log in with username 'webical' and password 'webical'. 
   If the system has not been configured, instructions will be 
   shown on the screen. You can access the configuration page manually 
   by visiting http://localhost:8080/webical/app/configuration and 
   configure the application.

                           ! WARNING !
      If you plan on using webical in a live environment, change the
      default usernames and passwords. Otherwise people will be able to
      access your application with the default settings.
                           ! WARNING !

   2.2 Custom installation

   If you don't want the default configuration, you can change it
   as follows.

   Most of the application settings described below can be found in the
   context.xml file which is located in the META-INF directory in the
   Webical root direcory. This file can be edited after the application
   is deployed in the Tomcat webapps directory
   ($CATALINA_HOME/webapps/webical/META-INF/context.xml).

   * Changing the default user:
   If you want to change the default login username and password from
   webical:webical to something different, you can edit the credentials
   at the bottom of AUTH_setup.sql or change them directly in the
   database.

   * Change database settings:
   If you want to change the database settings, edit context.xml.

   * Use a different database provider:
   It is possible to use a database provider other than MySQL. You have
   to install your own JDBC driver for Tomcat to use in 
   $CATALINA_HOME/common/lib, and change the <Resource> in context.xml.
   Check the hibernate.dialect property in the applicationContext.xmls in the
   WEB-INF sub-directory.

   * Use a different authentication realm:
   If you want to use a different relational database or an LDAP server
   for the Tomcat authentication realm, you can change this in the
   context.xml file. An LDAP authentication example is included within
   the file.
